# ThanosSnaps
A little exercise in population dynamics to see if Thanos snapping a population in half made a difference

I think Thanos could've studied some basic population dynamics to see how his solution of snapping half a population away may not be the best thing to do. But before this, I wasn't able to explain this to exasperated friends so I made some graphs to explain what I mean.
I found that- Thanos would have to time his snap when a population is closer to the carrying capacity of it's environment. If he snaps too early, there is only a small difference in the time it would take to reach carrying capacity.
But snapping the populaion in half is not a solution either- this is something he'd have to keep doing as a population nears some critical value close to the carrying capacity for this snapping to delay over crowding. Seems like a tiring job! 
This is no different from how you have to keep mowing your lawn once it gets too tall.

If I was an adviser to Thanos, I would've told him to maybe focus on reducing the rate at which a population increase (evil) or focus on improving the external environment by means of technology or medicine so that a growing population can be accomodated (good).

##Improvements to be made:
I have used the logarithmic growth curve formula to calculate population:
yt = c/(1+A*e^-B*t)
Although I mathematically know what constant B means, I am yet to figure out how to explain its biological meaning.
